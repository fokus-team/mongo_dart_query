# Changelog

## 1.0.0-nullsafety

### Potential breaking changes

* `AEList` and `AEObject` constructors do not accept null parameters
* The `AEList` iterator `current` getter now throws instead of returning null if `current` is undefined (`moveNext` not called or end of Iterable)
* In `SelectorBuilder` the `paramFields` map cannot be set directly any more, but the related method must be used (fields, excludeFields and metaTextScore)

## 0.4.2

* Fixed problem in SelectorBuilder:
if you set a raw map, then you couldn't add any new query expression or you loose the inital raw map "query" section.
* Lint clean-up
* Updated sdk constraint to 2.5.2

## 0.4.1

* class `Set` of aggregation stages moved to class `SetStage` to resolve conflict with `dart:core` library
